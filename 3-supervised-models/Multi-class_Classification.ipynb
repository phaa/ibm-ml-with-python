    "* The algorithm trains a single binary classifier for each class.\n",
    "* Each classifier learns to distinguish a single class from all the others combined.\n",

    "* Simpler and more efficient in terms of the number of classifiers (k)\n",
    "* Easier to implement for algorithms that naturally provide confidence scores (e.g., logistic regression, SVM).\n",

    "#### Disadvantages:\n",
    "* Classifiers may struggle with class imbalance since each binary classifier must distinguish between one class and the rest.\n",

    "* The algorithm trains a binary classifier for every pair of classes in the dataset.\n",
    "* If there are k classes, this results in $k(k-1)/2$ classifiers.\n",
    "* Each classifier is trained to distinguish between two specific classes, ignoring the rest.\n",
    "* During prediction, all classifiers are used, and a \"voting\" mechanism decides the final class by selecting the class that wins the majority of pairwise comparisons.\n",

    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "* Suitable for algorithms that are computationally expensive to train on many samples because each binary classifier deals with a smaller dataset (only samples from two classes).\n",
